# Automated-Baby-Care-ABC


Hi, Welcome to Automated-Baby-Care (ABC).

We have designed a system that analyzes a video of a baby and detect if the baby is crying. If so, the system will play soothing music and send an email notification to the parent/guardian. 

Steps :
1. Break the video into frames
2. Analyze the n'th frame for emotion
3. Detect the emotion and take appropiate action
